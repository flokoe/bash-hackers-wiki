# Directory

In terms of UNIX(r), a directory is a special file which contains a list
of [hardlinks](../dict/terms/hardlink.md) to other files. These other files
also can be directories of course, so it\'s possible to create a
\"hierarchy of directories\" - the UNIX(r)-typical filesystem structure.

The structure begins at the special directory `/` (root directory) and
all other directory entries are **subdirectories** of it.
