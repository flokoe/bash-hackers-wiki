# Bash compound commands

The main part of Bash\'s syntax are the so-called **compound commands**.
They\'re called like that because they use \"real\" commands ([simple
commands](../../syntax/basicgrammar.md#simple_commands) or
[lists](../../syntax/basicgrammar.md#lists)) and knit some intelligence around
them. That is what the essential \"Bash language\" is made of.

## Command grouping

-   grouping: [command grouping](../../grouping_plain.md)
-   grouping again: [command grouping in a subshell](../../grouping_subshell.md)

## Conditional reactions

Note that conditionals can also be scripted using
[list](../../syntax/basicgrammar.md#lists), which are syntax elements, not
commands.

-   the \"new\" test command: [conditional
    expression](../../conditional_expression.md)
-   if-clause: [conditional branching](../../if_clause.md)
-   case statement: [pattern-based branching](../../case.md)

## Loops

-   [classic for-loop](../../classic_for.md)
-   [C-style for-loop](../../c_for.md)
-   [while loop](../../while_loop.md)
-   [until loop](../../until_loop.md)

## Misc

-   math: [arithmetic evaluation](../../arithmetic_eval.md)
-   menus: [user selections](../../user_select.md)
