This cool hack uses the terminal capabilities (see ''terminfo(5)'' manual) **smcup** and **rmcup** to save and restore the terminal content.


For sure, you’ve already seen those programs that restore the terminal contents after they did their work (like ''vim'').

<code>
# save, clear screen
tput smcup
clear

# example "application" follows...
read -n1 -p "Press any key to continue..."
# example "application" ends here

# restore
tput rmcup
</code>
